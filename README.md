# Controlled Following and Landing of the Parrot Mambo on a Moving Platform
This is a practical project using the parrot mambo mini drone where, we make the drone land on a moving platform. It also contains a basic simulation in which the same is accomplished. The platform which is colored is recognized by the drone's camera which uses color recognition algoritms. This project is accomplished using Matlab & Simulink Models.

## Required Hardware
* Parrot Mambo Mini Drone (https://www.ebay.com/itm/275724579243?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=Lb3A38neQKe&sssrc=2047675&ssuid=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY)
* Line Follower Robot (https://a.co/d/4gAfXm2)
* Foam Platform (https://a.co/d/c5CGauX)

## Author Notes
* This project was developed as the final project for one of my courses. Please excuse any basic errors you may encounter. For the drone to make a good landing, get a good range of HSV values so that the platform is recognized, Some changes also may need to be done for the forward, backward, left & right velocities so that it is able to move in optimal speed depending on the external conditions.
